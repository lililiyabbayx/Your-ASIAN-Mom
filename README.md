**Project Overview:**
**YO my First ever hackathon hosted BY Audrey Chen
to evaluate my project idea used @nosu.io --> https://www.nosu.io/feedback/c0013009-281c-401d-856a-e7e8e3e6f3bf 
and freakin lifesaver @pear.ai**


As an undergrad student living far from home, I often find it challenging to keep up with the small daily tasks that I would typically rely on my mom to remind me about. While I’m lucky enough to live with my parents, many students live away from their families, and sometimes it's hard to stay motivated. We often miss the gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) reminders and pushes from mom. So, I came up with the idea of creating a humorous AI-powered app that mimics the sweet scolding, advice, and productivity nudges we all know and love (or maybe dread) from our moms. 

While I initially planned to build a mobile app, I decided to start with a web app to bring this idea to life. It's a mix of humor and functionality, designed to give us that much-needed "mom energy" to stay productive and feel connected, no matter where we are.

I hope you enjoy the prototype, and I plan to continue working on a fully functional AI version of the app!

## Getting Started

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YourAsianMom.git
   cd YourAsianMom



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
